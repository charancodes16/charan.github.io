            <p>I am currently a graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Informatics at Penn State University-University Park, with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction. My research areas encompass a broad range of topics, including human-computer interaction, digital transformation, accessibility, qualitative research, ubiquitous and wearable computing, human-AI interaction, interactive computing, and computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW). Under the guidance of my esteemed advisor, <a href="https://jcarroll.ist.psu.edu" style="color: #0066cc;">Dr. John M. Carroll</a>, I have had the privilege of working as a student researcher at the Collaboration Innovation Lab, where I have deepened my expertise and passion for these fields.</p>
            <p>I'm 22 & I grew up in Tamilnadu, India. I spent most of my childhood days on computers, Facebook, and the internet. I synced up with the digital world, basically a Dot Com guy. Dot com boom and computers put me into the attentive phase to study about Computers, Humans and Science. Went to Kumaraguru College of Technology BE with a major in computer science. I worked at HDFC Bank [NSE: HDFCBANK], Freecharge backed by Axis Bank [NSE: AXISBANK]. I was a founding member for an angel startup in capital markets.</p>
            <p>Internet. At age 13, exposure to Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs online ignited my interest in technology. Influences. Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs, Microsoft, Facebook, Social media, Computing, Internet, Stanford, Harvard, Silicon Valley.</p>
            <p>Computing. The 1984 Macintosh commercial opened my eyes to the future of computing. Influences. Xerox PARC, Apple, NEXT, IBM, Computing, Quantum concepts, Google, Macintosh Series, Product development, Phone interfaces, Interactive Computing.</p>
            <p>Understanding Humans. Increased interaction with the world led to a deeper understanding of human behavior. Passionate about travel, books, design, being idle, and being a good son, I cherish Macintosh 1984 and Facebook. These passions and interests shape my perspective and drive my endeavors in various aspects of life and technology.</p>
