        <h2>Reflections and Learnings of 2023</h2>
        <p><i>22 December, 2023 by Charan</i></p>
        <h4>Some of the perspectives and learnings in my 21. I would like to share here at the end of the year 2023.</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Find a place where you can drop the notions of good and bad, and where it brings you peace.</li>
            <li>What seeks you is seeking you.</li>
            <li>At one point, life gives you a signal about whether a commitment is working out for you or not.</li>
            <li>Connection has power and branches; sometimes you should consider it.</li>
            <li>Always schedule your phase and plan it properly. Don't break it or else you're leaving something behind. Scheduling makes miracles.</li>
            <li>Be attentive, disciplined, and punctual to schedules and plans when you think it's important.</li>
            <li>Time is precious. It's all about how you take things—whether to move forward, hold, or reach an endpoint.</li>
            <li>Observe people and learn from them. You can gain something that you can add to your plan or existing process.</li>
            <li>A good or a bad plan is better than no plan [learned from Peter Thiel].</li>
            <li>Sometimes, people's perspectives and nonsense can derail your plans. Analyze and make better decisions to avoid these threats.</li>
            <li>Aim for the long term; the short term is like a dopamine rush—try to avoid it.</li>
            <li>Questioning yourself will help align the process.</li>
            <li>Tailor-made days.</li>
            <li>It's always ok to say "I don't know" or "No".</li>
            <li>Mankind is great. Talk to people, make commitments, and respect them.</li>
            <li>Execution establishes the plan because plans are 5%; execution is 95%.</li>
        </ul>
