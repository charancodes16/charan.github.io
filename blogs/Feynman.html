            <p>I like physics! Apparently, I like computing more than physics, but I always try to take inspiration from physicists like Bohr, Einstein, and Richard Feynman. This page contains short notes or a summary from the book "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!" by Richard Feynman.</p>
            
            <h2>From Far Rockaway to MIT</h2>
            <h3><strong>He Fixes Radios by Thinking</strong>:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early Lab Setup:</strong> Set up a lab with an old wooden packing box, a heater, a storage battery, and a lamp bank. Experimented with different voltages.</li>
                <li><strong>Fuse System:</strong> Created custom fuses using tin foil and connected them to a bulb to signal when the fuse blew.</li>
                <li><strong>Interest in Radios:</strong> Started with a crystal set and eventually bought broken radios at rummage sales to fix them. Surprised family with accurate predictions by listening to radio programs an hour early on certain stations.</li>
                <li><strong>Burglar Alarm:</strong> Invented a simple burglar alarm using a battery and bell, which activated when his bedroom door was opened.</li>
                <li><strong>Fire Incident:</strong> Accidentally set a wastebasket on fire while experimenting with a Ford coil, but managed to extinguish it without his mother finding out.</li>
                <li><strong>Experiments and Inventions:</strong> Built an amplifier for a photocell and experimented with electric motors. Discovered that a loudspeaker could act as a microphone, allowing him to broadcast between floors in his house.</li>
                <li><strong>Radio Repair Business:</strong> Repaired radios during the Great Depression, gaining a reputation for fixing them by "thinking". Solved a variety of radio issues, including reversing tube orders to fix a noise problem.</li>
                <li><strong>Mathematical Puzzles and Competitions:</strong> Known for solving puzzles quickly and led his high school's algebra team. Invented his own mathematical problems and theorems.</li>
                <li><strong>Trigonometry Work:</strong> Independently worked out trigonometric relations and calculated values for sine, cosine, and tangent. Created his own symbols for trigonometric functions and mathematical operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Learning and Adaptation:</strong> Realized the importance of using standard symbols for effective communication. Fixed typewriters and developed typing symbols for equations, showing a consistent interest in solving mechanical and mathematical puzzles.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong>String Beans</strong>:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hotel Job:</strong> Worked at a resort hotel run by his aunt, alternating between desk clerk and busboy roles, working long hours with little pay.</li>
                <li><strong>Experience with Tipping:</strong> Disliked the tipping system and suggested being paid more instead of relying on tips, which was met with laughter. Learned to subtly encourage tips from customers by "forgetting" to bring ice until reminded.</li>
                <li><strong>Busboy Duties:</strong> Tried to invent a new way to handle trays, resulting in a mess. Noticed the contrast between the reality of kitchen work and the polished presentation in the dining room.</li>
                <li><strong>Dessert Story:</strong> Preferred desserts and was given six different desserts each night by the pantry lady.</li>
                <li><strong>Inventions:</strong> Created a gadget inspired by Leonardo da Vinci to turn off the light when leaving his room. Invented a method to cut string beans quickly using a knife stuck into a table, but accidentally cut his finger. Used an egg slicer to slice potatoes for salad, but they stuck together, leading to a reprimand from the chef.</li>
                <li><strong>Telephone Innovation:</strong> Modified the switchboard to identify calls from a distance by tying threads and pieces of paper to the flaps, but the system was too complicated for the boss to understand.</li>
                <li><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> Discovered the difficulties of implementing innovations in the real world, especially in a structured environment resistant to change.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong>Who Stole the Door?</strong>:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Introduction to MIT Fraternities:</strong> Jewish fraternities at MIT (Phi Beta Delta and Sigma Alpha Mu) competed for his pledge. Chose Phi Beta Delta and later became roommates with the guys who convinced him to join.</li>
                <li><strong>Fraternity Dynamics:</strong> Phi Beta Delta had two cliques: socialites and studious members, which compromised to help each other. The compromise helped him improve socially and academically.</li>
                <li><strong>Hazing Experiences:</strong> Blindfolded and left by a frozen lake with other pledges, they successfully found their way back by following telephone lines. Kidnapped by sophomores before a freshman vs. sophomore mud event; fought hard and earned a reputation.</li>
                <li><strong>Social and Academic Growth:</strong> Helped seniors with theoretical physics problems, learned from their discussions, and improved rapidly in his own studies. Attended open dances despite fraternity disapproval, met diverse people, and had unique experiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Dances with Deaf and Hard of Hearing:</strong> Took two girls to a hotel dance organized by the deaf and dumb club. Learned some sign language and enjoyed the inclusive and vibrant environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Unique Challenges:</strong> Communicated with signs at a cafeteria and had fun integrating into a different community.</li>
                <li><strong>Lessons and Reflections:</strong> Realized the importance of social balance, adapting to new environments, and the value of diverse experiences.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong>Latin or Italian?</strong>:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Love for Italian Radio:</strong> Enjoyed listening to an Italian radio station in Brooklyn as a boy, loved the sound of the language and its emotional expressions.</li>
                <li><strong>Fake Italian Phrases:</strong> Learned fake Italian phrases to respond to people. Developed confidence in using these phrases, even if they weren't real Italian.</li>
                <li><strong>Interaction with Italian Gardner:</strong> Used fake Italian to gesture to a gardener at Princeton, who responded happily, showing the power of confidence in communication.</li>
                <li><strong>Father-Daughter Banquet:</strong> Took his sister to a Girl Scouts father-daughter banquet because their father was unavailable. Found the fathers boring as they only talked about the stock market.</li>
                <li><strong>Entertaining the Girls:</strong> Fathers had to entertain the girls by reciting something; he recited a fake Italian poem with emotional expressions. The girls were amused and laughed, thinking it was funny.</li>
                <li><strong>Confusion Over the Language:</strong> After the event, a scoutmaster and a schoolteacher debated whether the poem was in Italian or Latin. Suggested they ask the girls, who understood it was a joke.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong>Always Trying to Escape</strong>:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Escaping Humanities at MIT:</strong> Chose astronomy and philosophy to fulfill humanities requirements, as they were closest to science.</li>
                <li><strong>English Class Struggles:</strong> Parodied assigned essays instead of directly addressing them. Wrote about social liberty instead of political liberty. Parodied Huxley's "On a Piece of Chalk" with "On a Piece of Dust." Couldn’t write a theme on Goethe’s "Faust," instead wrote "On the Limitations of Reason." Integrated his theme with Faust’s characters, received a B+.</li>
                <li><strong>Philosophy Class Challenges:</strong> Couldn’t understand the mumbling professor. Distracted himself by drilling holes in his shoe during class.</li>
                <li><strong>Stream of Consciousness Theme:</strong> Based on his father's question about how thoughts end when falling asleep. Observed his own process of falling asleep for four weeks. Noted disjointed thoughts and how they become less logical before sleep.</li>
                <li><strong>Dream Observations:</strong> Discovered he could observe and control his dreams. Noted he could dream in color and feel physical sensations. Realized he could incorporate external stimuli into dreams, but sometimes the stimuli weren’t real.</li>
                <li><strong>Lucid Dreaming Experiences:</strong> Experimented with controlling his dream direction. Observed how visual and tactile senses were connected in dreams.</li>
                <li><strong>Observations While Waking Up:</strong> Noted a feeling of being tied down when waking up, but reassured himself it was normal. Eventually, became less afraid of this feeling.</li>
                <li><strong>End of Dream Observations:</strong> Invented a false reason for why he could make observations (sleeping on a brass rod). Tired of the practice, his brain created a reason to stop.</li>
                <li><strong>Theory on Dream Interpretation:</strong> Believed the brain’s "interpretation department" creates coherent images from random nerve discharges.</li>
                <li><strong>Significance of Dreams:</strong> Had a dream that was easy to interpret (symbolizing girls he knew), supporting psychoanalytic theories. Friend Deutsch suggested real dream analysis is usually more complex.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong>The Chief Research Chemist of the Metaplast Corporation</strong>:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Job Search after MIT:</strong> Applied to Bell Labs multiple times but never got a job there. Had letters of recommendation to Bausch and Lomb and Electrical Testing Labs, but found no positions for physicists.</li>
                <li><strong>Meeting an Old Friend:</strong> Met a childhood friend on the beach who offered him a job at his small company that specialized in metal plating plastics.</li>
                <li><strong>Early Experiments:</strong> Recalled childhood magic shows with the friend, involving chemistry tricks and burning hands using benzine.</li>
                <li><strong>Role at Metaplast Corporation:</strong> Joined the small company with only four employees: a president, vice president (his friend), a salesman, and a bottle washer (his friend's brother). Worked as the "chief research chemist" experimenting with metal plating different plastics.</li>
                <li><strong>Challenges in Metal Plating:</strong> Discovered the process of plating silver on various plastics, improving and simplifying the process. Faced interruptions from the salesman needing quick results for potential clients.</li>
                <li><strong>Major Problems and Failures:</strong> Encountered a problem with an artist's plastic wheel, resulting in damaged plastic. Produced and sold silver-plated pens that eventually developed blisters and peeled, leading to the company's failure.</li>
                <li><strong>Reflections on Advertising:</strong> The company ran advertisements showcasing their metal-plated products, but these were not representative of their regular production quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Encounter with Frederic de Hoffmann:</strong> Years later at Los Alamos, met Frederic de Hoffmann, who had worked on metal plating plastics in England. Hoffmann believed the Metaplast Corporation was far advanced based on their advertisements, unaware of the reality.</li>
                <li><strong>Revelation:</strong> Revealed to Hoffmann that he was the "chief research chemist" of Metaplast Corporation, with a minimal staff, debunking the myth of a large, advanced research department.</li>
